Forward channel testing on link A

1. Check EOM

    Wait for EOM_DONE=1 flag, poll register 0x1407 bit 7
    Read EOM, read register 0x1407[6:0]
        EOM UI% = (EOM * 2) / 127
        Default EOM UI% limit = 25%

2. Check decode error count

    Read the decode error count to clear the register, read register 0x22
    Wait for a time delta
    Reread register 0x22 to determine if any decode errors occurred

3. Check AEQ Coefficients

    Read AGC register 0x1410[7:0] for gain value.
    Read BST register 0x1411[6:0] for boost value.
    Read OSN register 0x142E[5:0] for offset null value.
    Read DFE1 register 0x140F[6:0] for DFE1 coefficient value.
    Read DFE2 register 0x140E[6:0] for DFE2 coefficient value.
    Read DFE3 register 0x140D[6:0] for DFE3 coefficient value.
    Read DFE4 register 0x140C[6:0] for DFE4 coefficient value.
    Read DFE5 register 0x1413[6:0] for DFE5 coefficient value.
        Note for all DFE coefficients:
            if the DFE value >= 0x40 (64)
                DFE = 64 - DFE
            else
                DFE = DFE
