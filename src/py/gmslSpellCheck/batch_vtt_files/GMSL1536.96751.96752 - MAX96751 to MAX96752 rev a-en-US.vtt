00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.410
Hi everyone, welcome to today's demo.

4946dfe0-7bcd-4d63-9cb8-f2857eae65a1-0
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.825
My name is Katie Wong and I'm part of the
display Applications team for GMSL in the

4946dfe0-7bcd-4d63-9cb8-f2857eae65a1-1
00:00:16.825 --> 00:00:18.770
Automotive in Cabin Experience group.

08c38721-138b-469c-bac2-73a34aca1319-0
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.013
Today I'm going to be showing you how to
get video set up on a GMSL 2 link using

08c38721-138b-469c-bac2-73a34aca1319-1
00:00:24.013 --> 00:00:26.650
our HDMI serializer and our OLDID
serializer.

76b9ce09-3f87-40b3-ad1d-47e9b37c37a3-0
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.880
GMSL 2 is a packet based bi directional
architecture.

a5181e95-491f-45d7-a7d0-6c04be73f1ce-0
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.780
That means that in a display application
we're sending video data from our

a5181e95-491f-45d7-a7d0-6c04be73f1ce-1
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.745
serializer across to our deserializer and
then we're sending reverse channel data

a5181e95-491f-45d7-a7d0-6c04be73f1ce-2
00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:44.560
on our deserializer through our GMSL 2
link to our serializer.

91791ae3-3f28-481a-8a9f-6aa97ad1c526-0
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.000
So let's take a closer look at the
hardware and see what we have going on.

0ac74b34-023e-4917-8cc6-a5d26c55d9c3-0
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.176
So on the left hand side,
we have our HDMI input,

0ac74b34-023e-4917-8cc6-a5d26c55d9c3-1
00:00:54.176 --> 00:00:57.760
at the top left we have our 12 Volt
barrel Jack.

81f64351-fe63-40c2-9437-cb50e142c9a2-0
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.480
Right next to that we have our red on and
off switch for the EV kit.

d184174b-de9b-4a57-855f-6bae65546a86-0
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.320
And then right next to that we have
switch 3, which is a set of DIP switches.

4d075f8a-6cd0-4531-9495-3f4b56120032-0
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.552
So this configures the device address for
the device,

4d075f8a-6cd0-4531-9495-3f4b56120032-1
00:01:10.552 --> 00:01:13.280
which today we'll be using 0X80 for the
serializer.

12abb613-baf0-49c2-83fc-c0bb062be580-0
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.920
And we're also setting it for I to C mode
in coax.

13460ad9-449f-4dfe-b4e7-5b1fea6d053b-0
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.640
And then right next to this DIP switch,
we have these 3 headers.

c009485a-10b6-4d23-86a0-fe6015fcb152-0
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.800
The first one here is setting our BDDIO
voltage of 3.3 volts.

ad54e8b2-1785-40d2-b8ab-67ddf3de7cf5-0
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.960
And then right next to that,
we're configuring our EV kit for I2C mode.

e6a54b11-2ef5-412a-b507-95361b3e9a8d-0
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.156
And then here you'll see I have a micro
USB connected to talk to our Team C

e6a54b11-2ef5-412a-b507-95361b3e9a8d-1
00:01:35.156 --> 00:01:37.753
microcontroller,
which we'll be able to use to send

e6a54b11-2ef5-412a-b507-95361b3e9a8d-2
00:01:37.753 --> 00:01:41.200
commands across the Gmas L2 link to
configure our control registers.

9714e538-47cf-4c84-ab0e-cb79e5a0af6f-0
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.222
Right next to that,
at the very right hand side of the board,

9714e538-47cf-4c84-ab0e-cb79e5a0af6f-1
00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:48.280
we have our Gmas L2 output on Phi A.

6717e68e-ff80-4a91-a0f9-4e1fcea5921a-0
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.606
So this is going through our coax
connector,

6717e68e-ff80-4a91-a0f9-4e1fcea5921a-1
00:01:51.606 --> 00:01:54.440
through a coax cable and then onto our
deserializer.

2fc4bda1-370d-4b11-96ac-b30fd3ca5148-0
00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.170
So now focusing on our deserializer,
we have our coax input on Phi A on the

2fc4bda1-370d-4b11-96ac-b30fd3ca5148-1
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.120
left hand side.

9c57108f-0b19-4957-8e11-efca09892177-0
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.076
At the top here we have our 12 Volt
barrel Jack again,

9c57108f-0b19-4957-8e11-efca09892177-1
00:02:06.076 --> 00:02:10.840
and then right next to that we have our
red on and off switch again.

c98a3fe6-ac5f-43c2-a2e6-cdf63b011867-0
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.000
We have the same jumpers on the top here
for VDDDIO of 3.3 volts and also I2C.

e2e0a90e-8afe-40dd-a1b8-872287241dd1-0
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.600
Right next to that we have our DIP
switches again to set our configuration.

3d70193d-347f-4cde-9502-9496ee585513-0
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.920
So today for our deserializer,
we'll be using 0X90I2C and coax mode On

3d70193d-347f-4cde-9502-9496ee585513-1
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.600
the right hand side.

85cdcbce-7a82-4dfd-b2aa-5b002f4997b0-0
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.880
Here we have our GMSL OLDI adaptor,
so that is separate from our EV kit.

2ab4f977-c55a-4dd6-bb4d-f1b933e5b84c-0
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.042
And then this is connected through a Sam
tech connector,

2ab4f977-c55a-4dd6-bb4d-f1b933e5b84c-1
00:02:41.042 --> 00:02:43.800
which is then connected to our OLDI
display panel.

2fb61a40-1c45-4c21-bc91-a0d1db6e7953-0
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.452
So now that we have our equipment,
let's take a look at the EV kit data

2fb61a40-1c45-4c21-bc91-a0d1db6e7953-1
00:02:49.452 --> 00:02:49.800
sheets.

5ad0927c-c6ce-45bf-bd3d-dad734372776-0
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.450
So if you don't have the EV Kit data
sheets,

5ad0927c-c6ce-45bf-bd3d-dad734372776-1
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.080
you can find that on our product page.

6f8937a0-fd47-42d3-8736-9cb7383d2916-0
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.302
You should already have the worksheet
downloaded,

6f8937a0-fd47-42d3-8736-9cb7383d2916-1
00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:59.960
so please go ahead and download that if
you have not already.

528c94cb-dfc5-4625-bb54-0e0a7516d395-0
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.306
So for the first step of the worksheet,
check the configuration of the DIF switch,

528c94cb-dfc5-4625-bb54-0e0a7516d395-1
00:03:04.306 --> 00:03:07.663
Switch 3 on the serializer board and
indicate whether the switch is high or

528c94cb-dfc5-4625-bb54-0e0a7516d395-2
00:03:07.663 --> 00:03:07.840
low.

70986507-6b03-4a2b-83c9-a81173d9a78a-0
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.400
Also note the silk screen name for each
switch in the section shown.

aacc7a79-dc4c-4d3f-9f24-8519bb24c25e-0
00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.538
Moving on to the deserializer board,
again check the configuration of the DIF

aacc7a79-dc4c-4d3f-9f24-8519bb24c25e-1
00:03:18.538 --> 00:03:21.520
switch switch to and indicate whether the
switch is high or low.

466fee7e-658a-454d-9c62-9ad4c0129b5e-0
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.120
Also note the silk screen name for each
switch in the section shown.

618ec852-a632-4f03-a7ee-4551013ee98d-0
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.300
In my default setup,
the VDDIO header is set to 3.

618ec852-a632-4f03-a7ee-4551013ee98d-1
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.680
3 volts on both boards.

c9401f14-3c6d-4320-bfe7-ff387a0d6e63-0
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.960
That means the high is 3.
3 volts and low is 0 volts.

e59a0d66-fc55-4b0d-9089-ce3ce01c540c-0
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.432
In this next section,
you will want to indicate whether you are

e59a0d66-fc55-4b0d-9089-ce3ce01c540c-1
00:03:46.432 --> 00:03:49.280
using I to C or coax mode and also the
device address.

6b63f33f-ddc3-4180-aca6-2733c7f13de3-0
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.960
These are all configured by the DIF
switches mentioned before.

9e4e3fc9-cf9a-4e07-805d-58666db6a18d-0
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.778
Now that all of our hardware is
configured properly and we've had a good

9e4e3fc9-cf9a-4e07-805d-58666db6a18d-1
00:03:59.778 --> 00:04:02.144
look at the EV kit data sheet and device
data sheet,

9e4e3fc9-cf9a-4e07-805d-58666db6a18d-2
00:04:02.144 --> 00:04:05.760
let's power on our boards and see what we
see on the boards as we power them up.

da894e8a-719b-45df-89fe-ac8d7a166e13-0
00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.000
So just turning that red switch at the
top to the on position,

da894e8a-719b-45df-89fe-ac8d7a166e13-1
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.040
you'll see that the Teen C light is
flashing five times.

3ed6a360-0540-4082-bec3-dc13fb95f41a-0
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.963
So we do not want to activate any
commands at this point until we see a

3ed6a360-0540-4082-bec3-dc13fb95f41a-1
00:04:18.963 --> 00:04:19.960
solid red light.

312e3740-a78d-4a64-8450-f90affd5b52e-0
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.101
We'll also see a blue LED for the Teen C
power,

312e3740-a78d-4a64-8450-f90affd5b52e-1
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:27.569
a green LED to show that our GMSL 2 link
has locked,

312e3740-a78d-4a64-8450-f90affd5b52e-2
00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:32.805
And then we'll also see this red error
bar LED on our serializer that is due to

312e3740-a78d-4a64-8450-f90affd5b52e-3
00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:38.236
a difference in the default configuration
of our serializer device and the default

312e3740-a78d-4a64-8450-f90affd5b52e-4
00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:40.200
hardware that's on this board.

771792fd-9df9-4fe5-a7c1-9edb5e41443f-0
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.900
So later on in the GUI,
I'll show you how to remove this error

771792fd-9df9-4fe5-a7c1-9edb5e41443f-1
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.040
from the serializer because this is not
so relevant to our demo at the moment.

ce5d599d-76a8-474c-afee-b9d4e1123ca6-0
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.673
OK, Once you powered on these boards,
you'll also see the backlight on your

ce5d599d-76a8-474c-afee-b9d4e1123ca6-1
00:04:54.673 --> 00:04:59.199
OLDI panel show up and there is no video
going through to this display at this

ce5d599d-76a8-474c-afee-b9d4e1123ca6-2
00:04:59.199 --> 00:04:59.600
moment.

4226af90-cc08-465c-9a35-c193b6e021aa-0
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.800
So now we're going to fire up the GUI.

767167f6-23ab-4296-a75b-9eebf56d8623-0
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.444
If you do not already have the GUI,
please check out the product page to

767167f6-23ab-4296-a75b-9eebf56d8623-1
00:05:06.444 --> 00:05:09.240
download the GMSL GUI,
or you can find it on Sharefile.

af2bd930-8fd9-484a-aae0-121ee69a9d2d-0
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.040
So now we have our GMSL GUI up and
running.

19891903-51ce-439e-b4c6-e9ab4199f4b3-0
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.194
You'll see that it has identified our two
parts here with the serializer on the

19891903-51ce-439e-b4c6-e9ab4199f4b3-1
00:05:16.194 --> 00:05:19.160
left hand side and the deserializer on
the right hand side.

f38caf52-5de1-40ca-a635-ec2c4bdd9e5e-0
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.680
You'll also see the device addresses
showing as 0X80 on the serializer and

f38caf52-5de1-40ca-a635-ec2c4bdd9e5e-1
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.320
0X90 on the deserializer.

f96149bf-e6dd-439d-9dd6-e1360dd64e12-0
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.538
Right under that on the 1st 2 tabs,
you'll also see the names of the OLDID

f96149bf-e6dd-439d-9dd6-e1360dd64e12-1
00:05:32.538 --> 00:05:34.480
serializer and HDMI serializer.

7efbfd2d-10a2-482e-a108-34c5b00a3ad1-0
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.866
Looking at these tabs you can see all of
the registers related to these tabs and

7efbfd2d-10a2-482e-a108-34c5b00a3ad1-1
00:05:40.866 --> 00:05:45.080
we will now look at the air bar light
that we took a look at before.

f97d6091-cb07-4e3f-926a-d17b8da15eb7-0
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:52.560
So in our GUI we are going to navigate 2
tools status and air bar status.

8c72c46e-7a32-4c6f-8ce4-3f6acd53368a-0
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.150
So once this page is loaded and the
registers have refreshed for all of our

8c72c46e-7a32-4c6f-8ce4-3f6acd53368a-1
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.489
error bars,
you'll see that these line fault

8c72c46e-7a32-4c6f-8ce4-3f6acd53368a-2
00:06:00.489 --> 00:06:04.440
interrupt output enable is enabled by
that check box on the left hand side.

17a656c4-7e35-4b69-92f6-83c45a2be94a-0
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.739
So this is what is causing our error bar
light to turn on and we do not have our

17a656c4-7e35-4b69-92f6-83c45a2be94a-1
00:06:08.739 --> 00:06:11.480
line fault registers installed on this EV
kit at this moment.

2f7bed0c-eb8c-47ff-964e-97c907f3ac25-0
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.593
So once I uncheck this box and refresh
the error status,

2f7bed0c-eb8c-47ff-964e-97c907f3ac25-1
00:06:18.593 --> 00:06:22.800
you'll see that the red LED is now gone.

01641aa1-53fb-4fc3-9f4e-bd4b82234a89-0
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.818
So taking a look at our serializer board,
the error bar light was here before and

01641aa1-53fb-4fc3-9f4e-bd4b82234a89-1
00:06:27.818 --> 00:06:28.960
now it is turned off.

85c22d85-99d9-4f25-a3fc-0009f81ec1c0-0
00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.200
So now we have an active GMSL 2 link.

7bd12d2f-ce8f-4adb-8030-15365a90260e-0
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.775
So I'm going to show you on the GUI how
we can verify that this is an active

7bd12d2f-ce8f-4adb-8030-15365a90260e-1
00:06:35.775 --> 00:06:36.240
connection.

02bb4221-2d6f-40bf-aee1-645c0faa1642-0
00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.052
So taking a look at our serializer
register 00,

02bb4221-2d6f-40bf-aee1-645c0faa1642-1
00:06:42.052 --> 00:06:45.440
we have our device address at the left
here.

f00d6abe-4663-48c9-a34d-67dd3bd392e5-0
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.609
So we're going to do a simple read and on
the right hand side you'll see that we

f00d6abe-4663-48c9-a34d-67dd3bd392e5-1
00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:53.440
are reading device address 80 and the
result is 80.

c000d793-71ea-4bbf-bbf4-5a1ac69cff3a-0
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.749
So that shows that we have our active
connection on our serializer,

c000d793-71ea-4bbf-bbf4-5a1ac69cff3a-1
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:57.400
which is great.

62279c2e-b474-41d7-ad23-9dad5d3935ee-0
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.320
Next step,
we also want to check our deserializer.

e41f4ad3-3924-4c5c-936d-300b18c89851-0
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.320
So this is going to be going across our
link.

5bacdc5b-b6ec-4014-834d-d49786e5a14b-0
00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.954
We're going to go to device register 00
again,

5bacdc5b-b6ec-4014-834d-d49786e5a14b-1
00:07:06.954 --> 00:07:10.440
and we're going to read our device
address once more.

9c7ea925-2ac9-442c-bdad-344252c47d10-0
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.729
So just clicking read,
we'll see that on the right hand side

9c7ea925-2ac9-442c-bdad-344252c47d10-1
00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:19.240
we're reading device address 90,
and the result is 90, which is perfect.

888ed9cc-f09d-48e8-bef2-00bd2364403b-0
00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.513
Now that we've verified our active
connection,

888ed9cc-f09d-48e8-bef2-00bd2364403b-1
00:07:22.513 --> 00:07:26.480
we can now go ahead and load our edit to
get our display output running.

e41ef382-3634-44a2-8698-78b918423859-0
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.799
So I'm going to go very quickly to my low
level commands and I'm going to clear my

e41ef382-3634-44a2-8698-78b918423859-1
00:07:32.799 --> 00:07:37.240
history and I'm going to go to the top
left to look for my script file.

e7c20f29-8e59-4ba5-a4a2-56dad8a3d770-0
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:43.165
So here I'm going to click load CSV 16
bit register address,

e7c20f29-8e59-4ba5-a4a2-56dad8a3d770-1
00:07:43.165 --> 00:07:49.640
and you'll see that I have this 90201920
by 1200 P 60 edit ready to go.

db0c0639-d803-49be-88fc-b5264761840a-0
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.640
So I'm going to double click that.

8dccd6b1-99d1-4d78-99aa-98115a879956-0
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.249
And in my low level commands,
you'll be able to see all of the register

8dccd6b1-99d1-4d78-99aa-98115a879956-1
00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:56.840
rights going through in real time.

e73b09f6-5c27-4157-843f-d600bfbc2186-0
00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.240
So this takes a little bit of time.

c031c734-b196-4dd0-ac43-fbba7438125c-0
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.200
So we're just going to wait.

3e6ef5f3-1dad-4614-83ab-acf1bb4f2249-0
00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.127
All right,
so while we're waiting for our edit to

3e6ef5f3-1dad-4614-83ab-acf1bb4f2249-1
00:08:04.127 --> 00:08:05.840
load, let's take a look at our worksheet.

959ee453-4f85-4002-a231-3cf3f6976219-0
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.600
So we know that our edit is at 1920 by
1200 P at 60 Hertz.

5ecd0124-aee1-446f-933d-00f9162c8951-0
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.760
So let's do a rough calculation of our P
clock.

cca6290c-be5b-4bf8-9e6e-14de6666bf54-0
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.686
To do that,
you need your active width by your active

cca6290c-be5b-4bf8-9e6e-14de6666bf54-1
00:08:17.686 --> 00:08:18.040
height.

e05f2b29-a44f-4a14-ac5b-f54c2e71c751-0
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.572
We're going to use a rule of thumb
blanking ratio of about 1.2,

e05f2b29-a44f-4a14-ac5b-f54c2e71c751-1
00:08:22.572 --> 00:08:23.600
which is 20% plus.

abdccf53-5f70-4492-98d9-88cff9369c61-0
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.575
And we're going to have our frame rate
value,

abdccf53-5f70-4492-98d9-88cff9369c61-1
00:08:27.575 --> 00:08:31.920
which we're all going to multiply
together to get our P clock in Hertz.

0901cf48-b57f-47bb-9817-c4d9eea9db82-0
00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.657
So once your edit is loaded,
you'll have noticed that my screen did

0901cf48-b57f-47bb-9817-c4d9eea9db82-1
00:08:37.657 --> 00:08:40.040
blank a black screen for a couple seconds.

349d1166-fba1-47d7-9a31-db7a9877608d-0
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.800
And that means that our device has now
seen our EDID.

a75116be-9822-4f3d-8d25-473287994c38-0
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.958
Looking at our OLDI display panel,
you'll also see that there's still no

a75116be-9822-4f3d-8d25-473287994c38-1
00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:52.640
video yet because this is not configured
yet for our video.

d5b4aaca-43bd-4272-ab7a-8a37cfb4eda5-0
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.245
So now I'm going to show you some
register rights that we can do to get our

d5b4aaca-43bd-4272-ab7a-8a37cfb4eda5-1
00:08:56.245 --> 00:08:57.120
video output running.

74e953de-6963-41eb-b0db-2206da45abb7-0
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.363
So on our deserializer,
which is the second tab on the left,

74e953de-6963-41eb-b0db-2206da45abb7-1
00:09:02.363 --> 00:09:05.120
we're going to search for register one CE.

69003ce9-81c0-4671-a9f4-5df8bed9e800-0
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:14.033
We're going to go ahead and read that,
and we're going to configure our device

69003ce9-81c0-4671-a9f4-5df8bed9e800-1
00:09:14.033 --> 00:09:15.440
for this Oldi panel.

a0397d7c-49c3-4d1a-b2b3-75512ea052f6-0
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:23.360
So I'm going to write the value 5 E and
now our deserializer is configured.

803ca3a7-67b6-48f6-922a-a5bc6dce168b-0
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.859
Next,
I'm going to go to our serializer tab and

803ca3a7-67b6-48f6-922a-a5bc6dce168b-1
00:09:27.859 --> 00:09:29.680
I'm going to go to register 01.

a0761ca0-717a-4f24-897f-2bc808953e5e-0
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.291
Again,
I'm going to read this register and I'm

a0761ca0-717a-4f24-897f-2bc808953e5e-1
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:37.920
going to check on the box beside HDMI
auto start.

fc080b87-f9e8-4f80-8b7a-b20b75d123ec-0
00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.560
This has changed the hex value to a value
of C8.

67a07a01-92d3-4ed1-b7a1-d6e0bf5894ab-0
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.560
I'm now going to click right register.

e2219d09-c69a-4d31-80eb-fb34ae71e363-0
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:50.269
Looking at our OLDI display,
you'll now see that you'll have a replica

e2219d09-c69a-4d31-80eb-fb34ae71e363-1
00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:52.000
of my monitor on the screen.

39b1f5be-1832-456e-bbde-3ace1ece4a4c-0
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.167
So now that our edit is loaded,
we're going to check our HDMI timing to

39b1f5be-1832-456e-bbde-3ace1ece4a4c-1
00:09:58.167 --> 00:10:00.600
see what the actual values of our timing
are.

4fa3e742-cc1f-40ca-813c-a098519b5695-0
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:07.720
So let's look at tools status and then
HDMI timing.

debb42cf-b2d7-485a-9a45-7e8230318ed5-0
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.689
So clicking Calculate total values,
we'll be able to see what our HDMI

debb42cf-b2d7-485a-9a45-7e8230318ed5-1
00:10:14.689 --> 00:10:17.080
serializer is receiving from the HDMI
source.

c5bb9f1e-59c4-4f1b-81e7-f26a65ea5420-0
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.297
So looking at your worksheet,
let's fill in these values and calculate

c5bb9f1e-59c4-4f1b-81e7-f26a65ea5420-1
00:10:21.297 --> 00:10:22.040
our new P clock.

8fe623a2-f644-4117-8e95-28048599a36a-0
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.886
All right,
using the same method from before,

8fe623a2-f644-4117-8e95-28048599a36a-1
00:10:25.886 --> 00:10:28.880
we're going to calculate our P clock with
the active values that we saw.

158df858-a40d-421c-8ebb-18e458979418-0
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:35.259
All right,
I'm going to go ahead and close the HDMI

158df858-a40d-421c-8ebb-18e458979418-1
00:10:35.259 --> 00:10:44.583
tool and we're going to check a couple
registers to see that we have active

158df858-a40d-421c-8ebb-18e458979418-2
00:10:44.583 --> 00:10:45.320
video.

5939f049-4e32-4640-b83e-7c664cc34571-0
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.944
Obviously we have active video on the
Oldi display panel right now,

5939f049-4e32-4640-b83e-7c664cc34571-1
00:10:49.944 --> 00:10:54.340
but if you were not seeing any video and
you wanted to see what was happening,

5939f049-4e32-4640-b83e-7c664cc34571-2
00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.679
we have a couple registers you can check
on our serializer.

2f18d8ce-17fd-4517-81a6-564dd7f1dbec-0
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.920
We can search registers bit fields for P
clock.

ef7c4896-94c3-4576-b20e-74e2df25d86c-0
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.640
You'll see this first Register here has P
clock detect.

64d47301-ae43-466b-af2f-d6840d6952a7-0
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.800
So if I click read,
we expect this value to be high.

14e9516b-be22-48cc-a8aa-feba1ad146c6-0
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.760
There's also another P clock detect
register in pipe Y.

06142a1b-433f-4a8f-8718-1e86e81c365f-0
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.505
So if we click read on this,
you'll see that there is no active video

06142a1b-433f-4a8f-8718-1e86e81c365f-1
00:11:21.505 --> 00:11:22.040
on pipe Y.

a66cc257-d063-4323-9681-3f3b135fbe2f-0
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.360
We have not configured any video to go
through pipe Y, so that's as expected.

16586d30-920b-4fd9-b6de-bcfee59034c2-0
00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.840
Next, on our deserializer,
we can check our device for video lock.

488e003b-6a22-48be-a2cb-9b6a4c0c1d33-0
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.991
So very quickly,
I'm going to scroll back to the top so

488e003b-6a22-48be-a2cb-9b6a4c0c1d33-1
00:11:37.991 --> 00:11:40.200
that it searches through all of our
registers.

845b84c3-e482-40df-8d0f-59ff3117c717-0
00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.760
I'm going to search vid_lock.

a5826da4-c824-4c95-a6d8-bbb53a515d25-0
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.481
So now we're in a new register with video
lock and we're going to click read and

a5826da4-c824-4c95-a6d8-bbb53a515d25-1
00:11:50.481 --> 00:11:52.946
you'll see there that we have vid lock is
high,

a5826da4-c824-4c95-a6d8-bbb53a515d25-2
00:11:52.946 --> 00:11:56.440
which is as expected since we have video
going to our deserializer.

68d4d6b6-b979-40d7-9401-3ef82ceb4a45-0
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.480
Taking a look at our worksheet,
you'll see that these registers can be

68d4d6b6-b979-40d7-9401-3ef82ceb4a45-1
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.960
indicated as high or low.

44d9c24f-2e55-447e-b08f-82e1b504b8cc-0
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.160
So we can go ahead and fill that out.

b0a6260f-4517-439d-b917-e080c8e2b35a-0
00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:16.187
So now that we have video running,
we can move on to our extra credit

b0a6260f-4517-439d-b917-e080c8e2b35a-1
00:12:16.187 --> 00:12:16.520
section.

84f23795-ef36-4188-a4c3-dc5d563b8a2e-0
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.000
Great job in getting to the steps so far.

5999e3a1-7ce8-4308-a205-3140b4336d3b-0
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.534
So the first step on this that we're
going to do is we're going to open up our

5999e3a1-7ce8-4308-a205-3140b4336d3b-1
00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:24.120
edit script.

279d1d3d-cc1f-416f-aaf6-26fe611024a0-0
00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.920
So from my home screen,
I have my edit script ready to go.

7acfa38d-aaf9-40fd-a782-93d8d77c344d-0
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.600
I'm going to double click on that to open
the file.

fc445368-aaf5-480f-9dc2-141276ff740e-0
00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.336
All right,
to understand how to write a script for

fc445368-aaf5-480f-9dc2-141276ff740e-1
00:12:41.336 --> 00:12:44.995
our GMSL devices,
let's take a look at the convention for

fc445368-aaf5-480f-9dc2-141276ff740e-2
00:12:44.995 --> 00:12:46.320
typing our CSV files.

2d90367d-0311-454e-8fae-0090272e44a3-0
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:54.840
So in this first line, we have 0X80,
0X25F5, 0X00.

813add7e-2962-4d59-9e6f-bdd39749c8bf-0
00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.040
Taking a look at this that this means
that we're writing to device address 0X80.

9489fa6e-c741-4eef-93ec-623e73a6801a-0
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:09.720
We're writing to register 0X20F5 and
we're writing the value 0X00.

7b2e362c-e630-4f20-86c3-06f381e32d7f-0
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.405
So taking a look at the register rights
that we did in the GUI beforehand,

7b2e362c-e630-4f20-86c3-06f381e32d7f-1
00:13:15.405 --> 00:13:19.000
let's go to our worksheet and fill out
the correct syntax for this.

7f77e4be-9101-4e8c-937f-5d7a65cc698b-0
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.416
All right,
so now that we understand the syntax for

7f77e4be-9101-4e8c-937f-5d7a65cc698b-1
00:13:29.416 --> 00:13:32.887
writing a script for our devices,
let's go ahead and fill out those two

7f77e4be-9101-4e8c-937f-5d7a65cc698b-2
00:13:32.887 --> 00:13:34.430
commands that we had previously.

e766f695-f4ff-452a-ada7-685a5b5d65c3-0
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:40.799
So for our first line,
we're going to talk to device address

e766f695-f4ff-452a-ada7-685a5b5d65c3-1
00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:44.585
0X80,
we're going to talk to register 0X01,

e766f695-f4ff-452a-ada7-685a5b5d65c3-2
00:13:44.585 --> 00:13:48.200
and we're going to write the value 0 XC 8.

96af2edf-528b-4c52-aa3f-a8bcc3b8e117-0
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:53.080
This configures the HDMI auto start on
this device.

029cd5a9-e0a2-468a-92be-02694a92964b-0
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.600
Next we're going to enter the command for
our deserializer.

fc891bb4-607a-4b6b-a720-4a2296cf11c3-0
00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:09.680
So this is 0X ninety 0X1CE0X5 5E.

766e37ec-fb9c-4cd2-a544-60708757e49f-0
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.120
All right,
so now we can go ahead and save this file.

c3b4b529-3657-4443-ba58-75afab63ee78-0
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:21.773
So closing that,
I'm now going to power cycle my devices

c3b4b529-3657-4443-ba58-75afab63ee78-1
00:14:21.773 --> 00:14:22.880
on the bench.

8647b80d-b9e4-463f-a3d0-b1ccd08f0fa7-0
00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:32.484
Once again, you'll see your screen flash,
and you'll also notice that I have no

8647b80d-b9e4-463f-a3d0-b1ccd08f0fa7-1
00:14:32.484 --> 00:14:36.387
video coming out on my display again,
Now that we power cycle the devices,

8647b80d-b9e4-463f-a3d0-b1ccd08f0fa7-2
00:14:36.387 --> 00:14:40.031
we have to reconfigure them,
so I'm going to go ahead and power up my

8647b80d-b9e4-463f-a3d0-b1ccd08f0fa7-3
00:14:40.031 --> 00:14:40.759
GUI once more.

0532daaf-dfeb-4d1c-b53e-97bafa58e93c-0
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:09.272
OK, now that we have our GUI fired up,
we're going to go to our low level

0532daaf-dfeb-4d1c-b53e-97bafa58e93c-1
00:15:09.272 --> 00:15:09.880
commands.

225182e9-01c7-4998-8e99-c393429b29df-0
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:13.720
Let's clear this window so that we can
see the eeded running in real time.

41604306-647e-4f3f-8133-6bce338fc202-0
00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:17.000
And let's go ahead and load our script
that we saved off with this
Of code.

6ca9f010-372f-42bd-a92e-2de6450415f6-0
00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.760
Double clicking on this,
let's see the eeded going.

3dce8a6d-7360-4214-8f9a-10b2241cdbab-0
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.922
All right,
now that we included these two new lines

3dce8a6d-7360-4214-8f9a-10b2241cdbab-1
00:15:36.922 --> 00:15:39.682
to our script,
you can see that your display panel just

3dce8a6d-7360-4214-8f9a-10b2241cdbab-2
00:15:39.682 --> 00:15:43.525
powered up automatically without us
having to do any extra register rights in

3dce8a6d-7360-4214-8f9a-10b2241cdbab-3
00:15:43.525 --> 00:15:43.919
the GUI.

31c0cd0e-3f86-4820-a449-312fd153f749-0
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.976
OK,
now we can move on to Extra Credit 2 for

31c0cd0e-3f86-4820-a449-312fd153f749-1
00:15:48.976 --> 00:15:49.280
this.

fc78cdf3-7dc3-45ac-a264-e1ef8db5aecc-0
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.160
We're going to fire up the GUI one last
time.

24526b76-0aa2-4568-8c26-8fec37a33ac7-0
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:15.355
Great, Now with our GUI fired up,
we're going to load our non modified edit

24526b76-0aa2-4568-8c26-8fec37a33ac7-1
00:16:15.355 --> 00:16:18.240
script from the very first step of this
lab one more time.

3f40733c-b4b5-41b1-a4d6-30577f27aca5-0
00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.801
Now that our edit is loaded,
you can see that the script ran error

3f40733c-b4b5-41b1-a4d6-30577f27aca5-1
00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:44.180
free with this green LED status and that
our screen blinked black one last time.

46a4b733-939c-4032-a99e-64cd506733e9-0
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:51.220
Going to our tools at the very top,
we're going to go to video config,

46a4b733-939c-4032-a99e-64cd506733e9-1
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.580
OLDI configuration.

10fa799d-a73a-44fa-a43a-a1e37c403b63-0
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.400
We're going to choose dual OLDI.

bfe00d4b-d4a5-4c07-ab8d-a519cd0b9920-0
00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.640
We're going to enable OLDI 4th lane.

65a6b729-ab54-4fb3-b8f2-ef0080fbd88f-0
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.520
We're going to change OLDI format to VESA.

90d2d619-922c-4be2-8ff9-7ea4c30f6920-0
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:09.435
We're going to disable spread spectrum,
enable swap ports A&amp;B,

90d2d619-922c-4be2-8ff9-7ea4c30f6920-1
00:17:09.435 --> 00:17:13.360
and disable lane mapping for GMSL stream
ID 0.

c084282e-3242-4930-b7a0-ccf0a98b746b-0
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:18.868
Before we configure the deserializer,
let's save off the script so we can look

c084282e-3242-4930-b7a0-ccf0a98b746b-1
00:17:18.868 --> 00:17:19.480
at it later.

03e89423-875b-404a-a7a2-d3a23dfad18f-0
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:32.360
Now that we have the script saved off,
we can configure our deserializer.

2e5408cc-b02b-42fb-ae45-6a4b73e68749-0
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.760
You'll see in the Command status window
at the bottom that it says Configuration

2e5408cc-b02b-42fb-ae45-6a4b73e68749-1
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:38.120
complete.

70bf7226-29f8-4696-9543-255c24447f9a-0
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.480
We can now close this GUI tool.

29fce26d-7ded-4f34-9122-7390134a1e81-0
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.680
Now let's go again to tools at the top,
Video Config and HDMI configuration.

dde41db0-c1f7-4bb7-b601-83e5f89d9f8a-0
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.975
Taking a look at the configuration
parameters here,

dde41db0-c1f7-4bb7-b601-83e5f89d9f8a-1
00:17:51.975 --> 00:17:54.560
we're going to keep HDMI enabled,
Disabled, checked.

f1f58960-9432-4951-b1eb-b8e1683f95da-0
00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.726
We're going to turn off the two audio
check boxes because we are not using

f1f58960-9432-4951-b1eb-b8e1683f95da-1
00:17:58.726 --> 00:17:59.600
audio in this demo.

3ce675cb-68aa-475c-853c-052349bd2bdf-0
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.633
For Edit table, we're going to choose No,
toggle, HPD, Editable load,

3ce675cb-68aa-475c-853c-052349bd2bdf-1
00:18:05.633 --> 00:18:07.880
and this is all for Stream ID 0.

0066a309-05ae-42ef-8120-aa89ab919dd0-0
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.716
Again, we're going to click File,
and we're going to create our script once

0066a309-05ae-42ef-8120-aa89ab919dd0-1
00:18:12.716 --> 00:18:13.000
again.

4e3b98a0-821b-4615-9abb-9edef670cb68-0
00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:22.035
So now we'll name this file and click
File one more time and click Configure

4e3b98a0-821b-4615-9abb-9edef670cb68-1
00:18:22.035 --> 00:18:23.120
Serializer.

cbab8491-e251-4037-8c57-5c0e21d5b723-0
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.520
You'll see in the Command status window
that it now says Configuration Complete.

fae29b49-d1bf-40fb-a877-c71f67c0e9c3-0
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.680
We can now also close this tool.

60cefc1d-695e-48c6-8914-d305208c3b60-0
00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:37.581
So now that we've used the GUI tools to
configure our serializer and deserializer

60cefc1d-695e-48c6-8914-d305208c3b60-1
00:18:37.581 --> 00:18:41.150
and have our edit loaded,
you'll see output on your OLDI display

60cefc1d-695e-48c6-8914-d305208c3b60-2
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.480
panel.

92894bc4-450c-46f0-8472-98fdf9087403-0
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.110
So let's open up those CSV scripts that
we created through the GUI tools and take

92894bc4-450c-46f0-8472-98fdf9087403-1
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:51.400
a look at what changed now that you've
located the scripts that you've found.

6c14f626-5b0f-4d87-b2bf-66b971f7f016-0
00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.173
OK,
taking a look at our device data sheet,

6c14f626-5b0f-4d87-b2bf-66b971f7f016-1
00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:04.040
you'll see that there is a Power on Reset
value.

8c06bf7e-7cb7-4349-b4bc-d5ba7b8095dc-0
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.263
Take a look and compare these values from
the script to the power on Reset values

8c06bf7e-7cb7-4349-b4bc-d5ba7b8095dc-1
00:19:09.263 --> 00:19:10.120
in the data sheet.

2a6c6f42-54a9-44ea-80d8-ba88400bd1db-0
00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.560
Fill these out in your worksheet.

262c2bb8-19a4-4603-861f-245fc6259f67-0
00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.800
Are there any differences in these values?

40e0d8ae-e1bd-411c-be7e-dd057e077d0f-0
00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:31.000
Doing the same thing with our all DID
serializer script.

86e88970-f564-4697-a08f-815f1b65fed9-0
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:35.033
Let's compare these values that we are
writing to to the registers power on

86e88970-f564-4697-a08f-815f1b65fed9-1
00:19:35.033 --> 00:19:36.960
reset values in the device data sheets.

19575738-7bdf-444e-8517-1db46215cb13-0
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.600
Do you see any differences in these
values?

ce9dd85c-fca4-4f93-a052-f5b0be718bf8-0
00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:50.305
Now that we've compared those two scripts,
you'll see that the same register rights

ce9dd85c-fca4-4f93-a052-f5b0be718bf8-1
00:19:50.305 --> 00:19:53.945
that we did in the tools are the same as
extra credit number one and the display

ce9dd85c-fca4-4f93-a052-f5b0be718bf8-2
00:19:53.945 --> 00:19:54.170
demo.

c304aaf4-d985-439c-ad9c-1c947a726c87-0
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:57.210
So now we have working video output.

74988cb2-c403-49a9-ab0a-1a7f154ccc04-0
00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.010
If you have any questions,
please feel free to reach out.
