39a0cf83-9e00-4774-804d-7bd567f7575e-0
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.320
Hello and welcome.

aab26dec-9c41-4d4a-b5b7-79a430069b3e-0
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.908
Today we're going to take a look
at the phenomenon of

aab26dec-9c41-4d4a-b5b7-79a430069b3e-1
00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:16.488
electrostatic discharge, or ESD,
and how it affects integrated

aab26dec-9c41-4d4a-b5b7-79a430069b3e-2
00:00:16.488 --> 00:00:17.000
circuits.

054cf592-eb62-47e0-9e7e-74b5997df648-0
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.858
Electrostatic discharge is just
one of an entire range of

054cf592-eb62-47e0-9e7e-74b5997df648-1
00:00:21.858 --> 00:00:25.689
phenomena that come under the
heading of electromagnetic

054cf592-eb62-47e0-9e7e-74b5997df648-2
00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.840
compatibility, or EMC for short.

cba85c5e-869e-4d5d-9c8f-be9f1307663f-0
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.927
Now, Simply put, the study of EMC
concerns itself with how an

cba85c5e-869e-4d5d-9c8f-be9f1307663f-1
00:00:31.927 --> 00:00:35.632
electronic device responds to
electromagnetic disturbances and

cba85c5e-869e-4d5d-9c8f-be9f1307663f-2
00:00:35.632 --> 00:00:39.221
how an electronic device might
disturb other devices through its

cba85c5e-869e-4d5d-9c8f-be9f1307663f-3
00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:41.280
own electromagnetic emissions.

11b58f83-a8ba-42c6-a383-1d2ca4321701-0
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.361
Most frequently we study how a
device responds to radiated

11b58f83-a8ba-42c6-a383-1d2ca4321701-1
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:49.615
energy and conducted energy over
a range of frequencies and how

11b58f83-a8ba-42c6-a383-1d2ca4321701-2
00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:53.670
much energy a device radiates as
radio waves and launches on

11b58f83-a8ba-42c6-a383-1d2ca4321701-3
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.000
attached conductors.

b7b0f513-c979-4dc8-89a5-fad740fb4931-0
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.983
Frequently we look at a specific
type of conducted energy known as

b7b0f513-c979-4dc8-89a5-fad740fb4931-1
00:00:58.983 --> 00:01:02.234
electrical fast transient or EFT,
and that's a particularly

b7b0f513-c979-4dc8-89a5-fad740fb4931-2
00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:05.228
difficult kind of conducted
interference that's caused by

b7b0f513-c979-4dc8-89a5-fad740fb4931-3
00:01:05.228 --> 00:01:08.480
some fluorescent lamp fixtures
and other electrical equipment.

85290dd0-7288-4d15-8508-7946513f9036-0
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.330
Modern microcontroller based
devices have to be able to

85290dd0-7288-4d15-8508-7946513f9036-1
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.232
tolerate this kind of
interference without damage and

85290dd0-7288-4d15-8508-7946513f9036-2
00:01:15.232 --> 00:01:16.200
without resetting.

5c94ee4c-a208-477f-84da-86f73462e729-0
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.128
But today we're going to be
looking at another sticky form of

5c94ee4c-a208-477f-84da-86f73462e729-1
00:01:20.128 --> 00:01:23.480
electromagnetic interference,
electrostatic discharge.

5abe60b0-2ba9-4397-b4ab-1f4809cc31dd-0
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.480
Now, to begin with, let's have a
look at what ESD actually is.

7e76ad73-6a4b-4ef6-af1d-4df27b35ccfb-0
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.141
The most obvious and the most
spectacular example of

7e76ad73-6a4b-4ef6-af1d-4df27b35ccfb-1
00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:34.480
electrostatic discharge is
lightning.

194b1bcc-e903-4250-8ec2-38c68b6c1c8e-0
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.104
In many parts of the world, some
seasons bring thunderstorms, and

194b1bcc-e903-4250-8ec2-38c68b6c1c8e-1
00:01:39.104 --> 00:01:42.848
those storms frequently present
us with beautiful displays of the

194b1bcc-e903-4250-8ec2-38c68b6c1c8e-2
00:01:42.848 --> 00:01:44.720
awesome power of lightning.

04828ac3-f1f4-4c1b-9ec3-310165de6b88-0
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.047
Lightning results when friction
between ascending and descending

04828ac3-f1f4-4c1b-9ec3-310165de6b88-1
00:01:50.047 --> 00:01:54.375
atmospheric currents in a storm
cloud 'cause electric charges to

04828ac3-f1f4-4c1b-9ec3-310165de6b88-2
00:01:54.375 --> 00:01:56.440
segregate into different areas.

bc845dde-6c50-4d03-a264-a10985537650-0
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.344
Now, as these charges accumulate,
the likelihood of an

bc845dde-6c50-4d03-a264-a10985537650-1
00:02:00.344 --> 00:02:02.320
electrostatic discharge
increases.

35a0fb12-b504-48ca-8961-dabab3bb475c-0
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.004
And when the discharge occurs,
you get the phenomena you

35a0fb12-b504-48ca-8961-dabab3bb475c-1
00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:09.319
normally associate with
lightning, a bright flash of

35a0fb12-b504-48ca-8961-dabab3bb475c-2
00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.946
light as the electron flow
ionizes and heats the air into

35a0fb12-b504-48ca-8961-dabab3bb475c-3
00:02:12.946 --> 00:02:16.949
incandescents, and the sound of
Thunder as the Super heated air

35a0fb12-b504-48ca-8961-dabab3bb475c-4
00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:18.200
explosively expands.

e85711c8-6805-4b60-95e5-e2a61becf5b3-0
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.720
Now let's think about lightning a
little more closely.

408722df-91a5-45e2-877b-248588770fad-0
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.610
You have a segregation of charges
of opposite polarity and an

408722df-91a5-45e2-877b-248588770fad-1
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.600
insulating dielectric layer the
air.

01027a94-115b-4c06-8abd-2d2c478bf4bb-0
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.088
When the charge potential becomes
too great, the air dielectric

01027a94-115b-4c06-8abd-2d2c478bf4bb-1
00:02:33.088 --> 00:02:36.040
breaks down and the air is
ionized.

e2414a82-4273-46fa-b917-cb24f7ccfccd-0
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.818
That is, the electrons are
stripped from the molecules that

e2414a82-4273-46fa-b917-cb24f7ccfccd-1
00:02:39.818 --> 00:02:43.240
make up the air, and the result
is a super heated plasma.

05f1df01-16d9-4d80-9592-6a3a4022859d-0
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.269
Of course, when the electric
strike is over, the air cools,

05f1df01-16d9-4d80-9592-6a3a4022859d-1
00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.800
the electrons resume their normal
orbits, and all is well.

09b3fb18-50f2-449d-a6a8-e539565b49f1-0
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.607
That is, unless you happen to be
in the vicinity of the lightning

09b3fb18-50f2-449d-a6a8-e539565b49f1-1
00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:54.960
strike.

e3f1c18c-dcd8-4b91-b288-5c5190b6d971-0
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.000
OK, now let's think smaller.

cb3bbcf9-3370-4d9c-8ffa-bb1e8753fafd-0
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.018
When the humidity is low, most of
us have had the experience of

cb3bbcf9-3370-4d9c-8ffa-bb1e8753fafd-1
00:03:03.018 --> 00:03:06.986
walking across a carpet, reaching
for a door knob and ZAP boy, that

cb3bbcf9-3370-4d9c-8ffa-bb1e8753fafd-2
00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:08.560
really hurts.

ff1a9f6f-5fc9-45f7-8d90-166bdee28288-0
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.120
The same thing has happened.

a456415f-682a-4224-b763-d5a71e9b7cdc-0
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.371
A charge difference between the
door knob and your body, which by

a456415f-682a-4224-b763-d5a71e9b7cdc-1
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:18.963
the way is actually quite
conductive, has resulted in an

a456415f-682a-4224-b763-d5a71e9b7cdc-2
00:03:18.963 --> 00:03:20.760
electrostatic discharge event.

45cf1b0a-4e01-467d-a4d6-a7bb3678a116-0
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.640
The air was ionized.

b4236eb1-e35e-4ab0-8795-6c6df74cf44c-0
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.680
A sound was heard as the air
super heated and expanded.

2da5ca26-79cb-4938-99e6-1dfa1a7e84c8-0
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.325
The same kind of thing can happen
to integrated circuits, but there

2da5ca26-79cb-4938-99e6-1dfa1a7e84c8-1
00:03:29.325 --> 00:03:31.400
are a couple of differences.

2525e192-f60c-4c28-b380-c7b4491e688c-0
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.372
The dielectric isn't air, it's
silicon dioxide or glass, and the

2525e192-f60c-4c28-b380-c7b4491e688c-1
00:03:35.372 --> 00:03:38.120
glass can't repair itself like
the air can.

c4f1ac7b-f1ff-45e7-953a-bfdad6f87c5d-0
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.710
Let's think about what happens
inside an integrated circuit when

c4f1ac7b-f1ff-45e7-953a-bfdad6f87c5d-1
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.240
an ESD event occurs.

bcb64a52-bb96-4dde-b81f-baf56f515f8b-0
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.916
Well, the first thing there
probably isn't going to be a

bcb64a52-bb96-4dde-b81f-baf56f515f8b-1
00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:52.214
spark, and to understand why we
need to think about the structure

bcb64a52-bb96-4dde-b81f-baf56f515f8b-2
00:03:52.214 --> 00:03:54.040
of a Moss transistor.

0144092a-39ce-4ee1-8d5e-c092092513ff-0
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.725
A Moss transistor consists of a
channel that can be either

0144092a-39ce-4ee1-8d5e-c092092513ff-1
00:03:58.725 --> 00:04:00.360
conducting or non conducting.

4d4e5f9d-f8e0-4f61-b6a9-40973265e43a-0
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.300
The state of the channel is
controlled by a gate electrode

4d4e5f9d-f8e0-4f61-b6a9-40973265e43a-1
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.911
that is electrically isolated
from the channel by a thin layer

4d4e5f9d-f8e0-4f61-b6a9-40973265e43a-2
00:04:07.911 --> 00:04:09.000
of silicon dioxide.

beee33a9-c9bd-4379-8d3d-831ea448a9fc-0
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.708
The electric field caused by the
potential of the gate relative to

beee33a9-c9bd-4379-8d3d-831ea448a9fc-1
00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:17.457
the potential of the channel
controls the flow of current in

beee33a9-c9bd-4379-8d3d-831ea448a9fc-2
00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:18.159
the channel.

bcad0ef1-a98d-46f9-a7f6-85bfacc6d6c9-0
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.999
All well and good, but to
maximize the influence of the

bcad0ef1-a98d-46f9-a7f6-85bfacc6d6c9-1
00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:27.399
electric field on the channel,
that gate insulator has to be

bcad0ef1-a98d-46f9-a7f6-85bfacc6d6c9-2
00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:27.760
thin.

d75adacb-d8a4-4555-8177-08d40be4915f-0
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.560
Perhaps as thin as 10 nanometers.

f2a12809-8935-4c45-9ca8-be202de0a26a-0
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.760
So that's the struggle.

8e185335-209d-4ff5-8558-483d29528788-0
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.988
We need to get a gate insulator
as thin as it can be, but also

8e185335-209d-4ff5-8558-483d29528788-1
00:04:36.988 --> 00:04:39.960
with as much dielectric strength
as possible.

bf11bede-a32e-411e-86f7-5217d52c9a0b-0
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.600
OK, it's time to break out the
math.

353cebb3-85df-492d-b857-78eb600a5748-0
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.680
First, think about air.

e8da6602-a07b-49c1-98b5-1a9786bcb1df-0
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.488
The dielectric strength of dry
air is about 36,000 volts per

e8da6602-a07b-49c1-98b5-1a9786bcb1df-1
00:04:49.488 --> 00:04:50.240
centimeter.

05a019cd-bcef-4fb6-9f25-d32954f023e2-0
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.880
So think about that for a second.

3024c58f-e8c7-4304-b8e8-b46753644e5a-0
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.221
If you draw a half centimeter arc
when your finger approaches a

3024c58f-e8c7-4304-b8e8-b46753644e5a-1
00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:00.624
door knob, you've probably
experienced a potential

3024c58f-e8c7-4304-b8e8-b46753644e5a-2
00:05:00.624 --> 00:05:03.000
difference of close to 20,000
volts.

46c0f20c-48b3-4d19-892b-a9e824d9878e-0
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.520
Great job.

945ec491-825d-4560-8eb4-f56fab346640-0
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.408
Well, for silicon dioxide, as it
appears in semiconductor

945ec491-825d-4560-8eb4-f56fab346640-1
00:05:09.408 --> 00:05:12.955
materials, the dielectric
strength is on the order of 10

945ec491-825d-4560-8eb4-f56fab346640-2
00:05:12.955 --> 00:05:14.760
million volts per centimeter.

8e4570ab-303f-45cf-8a27-658e4e04e632-0
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.080
Well, that should surely be
enough, one would think.

0ac22b36-0fc6-45ef-bad3-96062c7e6436-0
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.228
Well, the problem is that 10
nanometers is 1 millionth of a

0ac22b36-0fc6-45ef-bad3-96062c7e6436-1
00:05:25.228 --> 00:05:26.040
centimeter.

ae7cfd3d-fd63-4049-91d5-b366666c6b4d-0
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.513
That means that the gate can
tolerate at most about 10 volts

ae7cfd3d-fd63-4049-91d5-b366666c6b4d-1
00:05:30.513 --> 00:05:34.369
before it breaks down, And since
we've already seen that your body

ae7cfd3d-fd63-4049-91d5-b366666c6b4d-2
00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:38.412
can accumulate over 10,000 volts
of potential, it's easy to see

ae7cfd3d-fd63-4049-91d5-b366666c6b4d-3
00:05:38.412 --> 00:05:42.454
that you're pretty likely to
cause a dielectric breakdown in

ae7cfd3d-fd63-4049-91d5-b366666c6b4d-4
00:05:42.454 --> 00:05:45.440
any unprotected gauge just by
routine handling.

fb9d473d-c327-484a-80c4-b9812a06f672-0
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.320
Well, I mean, that's OK, right?

deec359a-8777-4d82-afcb-33501ce8d7c0-0
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.795
Because when the lightning
strike occurs, the air heals

deec359a-8777-4d82-afcb-33501ce8d7c0-1
00:05:52.795 --> 00:05:53.080
itself.

b4f77bf4-478b-4e55-931b-e88107cedd9a-0
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.960
Doesn't silicon dioxide do the
same thing?

03cfd946-4a79-4d47-af02-80188faa4007-0
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.600
Good try.

e7819926-1f71-4f9f-b0f8-0cf669566e75-0
00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.520
But no.

30ef9178-03ae-4e8f-a2fe-aff6c6790496-0
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.880
See, here's the thing.

6dccf602-cbe8-4ec0-b824-1da0ecfb4463-0
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.956
In air, the discharge path leaves
a trail of ionized oxygen and

6dccf602-cbe8-4ec0-b824-1da0ecfb4463-1
00:06:04.956 --> 00:06:05.840
nitrogen.

c07e9f5c-fec1-4b44-b683-e2742adcb8bd-0
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.932
Some of the ionized oxygen forms
ozone, giving you that nice after

c07e9f5c-fec1-4b44-b683-e2742adcb8bd-1
00:06:10.932 --> 00:06:12.520
a shower smell.

87efd842-e16e-4512-99f4-a7f21a99626a-0
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.480
And some of the ionized nitrogen
forms oxides of nitrogen.

1193ce5a-3b9a-4e50-b609-2afa1b8b2332-0
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.200
And that's good for the flowers.

3c139395-488f-4aec-ac79-e20372979d38-0
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.260
In any case, natural processes
cause the compounds to dissipate

3c139395-488f-4aec-ac79-e20372979d38-1
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.297
over time, and soon the air
returns to normal, no harm, no

3c139395-488f-4aec-ac79-e20372979d38-2
00:06:27.297 --> 00:06:27.640
foul.

6d38c4f8-0bf1-4a58-81fc-32855aee1db1-0
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.640
But in solids, the situation is
quite different.

ac6c296a-d446-4a05-afa4-845e78f771b2-0
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.749
Electrostatic discharge causes
localized heating that exceeds

ac6c296a-d446-4a05-afa4-845e78f771b2-1
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:39.014
the melting point of the
dielectric material, in this case

ac6c296a-d446-4a05-afa4-845e78f771b2-2
00:06:39.014 --> 00:06:39.680
glass.

6169f948-0ae5-4cd9-ba1a-79d673395208-0
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.128
This damage can destroy the
functionality of a semiconductor

6169f948-0ae5-4cd9-ba1a-79d673395208-1
00:06:44.128 --> 00:06:45.240
device in two ways.

ca299f8c-05dd-48e2-a2a7-f3ca3f364ff2-0
00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.886
1st, for just an instant during
the discharge event, the

ca299f8c-05dd-48e2-a2a7-f3ca3f364ff2-1
00:06:49.886 --> 00:06:53.120
conduction path is carrying a
tremendous current.

9307fb27-7f66-44ae-b57f-bb4f485a65ab-0
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.956
This current can vaporize the
tiny conductors etched into the

9307fb27-7f66-44ae-b57f-bb4f485a65ab-1
00:06:56.956 --> 00:06:58.280
active layers of the chip.

9bf29ad5-a92c-4d0a-8637-3ef76ceafccb-0
00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:03.327
Suddenly, where you had a
conduction path before, you have

9bf29ad5-a92c-4d0a-8637-3ef76ceafccb-1
00:07:03.327 --> 00:07:05.800
none and the device stops
working.

c349e015-1fac-4a98-9a37-2e9d54cd7ff5-0
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.040
The second failure path is called
punch through.

49534450-cfc6-4886-a499-012c5646698b-0
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.109
It's when the gate oxide melts
along with parts of the metal

49534450-cfc6-4886-a499-012c5646698b-1
00:07:14.109 --> 00:07:17.313
gate and the molten metal and
glass short the connection

49534450-cfc6-4886-a499-012c5646698b-2
00:07:17.313 --> 00:07:20.461
between the gate and the
conduction channel of the Moss

49534450-cfc6-4886-a499-012c5646698b-3
00:07:20.461 --> 00:07:21.080
transistor.

bd5a41b9-39f7-491d-9e8d-3b6a02c93f9b-0
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.227
Effectively the transistor can no
longer switch and once again the

bd5a41b9-39f7-491d-9e8d-3b6a02c93f9b-1
00:07:26.227 --> 00:07:28.000
device stops working.

7b09056d-9758-4330-ab38-0ea450f42790-0
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.011
Now sometimes an ESD event
doesn't actually destroy the

7b09056d-9758-4330-ab38-0ea450f42790-1
00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:33.320
part.

9b285992-8d2f-4351-8b9c-adce5902c46a-0
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.606
In some cases it can just
diminish the performance of the

9b285992-8d2f-4351-8b9c-adce5902c46a-1
00:07:36.606 --> 00:07:36.960
device.

8dcb0086-9978-4828-b498-fda9b09bc11e-0
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.185
If the gate of the transistor is
compromised, the gain may be

8dcb0086-9978-4828-b498-fda9b09bc11e-1
00:07:41.185 --> 00:07:44.160
reduced or the threshold voltages
might be altered.

78c75015-ef48-48dc-bacb-1f5909e390fc-0
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.173
Hey, even worse, you might not
see any reduction in the

78c75015-ef48-48dc-bacb-1f5909e390fc-1
00:07:48.173 --> 00:07:51.643
performance in the near term, but
the device may have less ability

78c75015-ef48-48dc-bacb-1f5909e390fc-2
00:07:51.643 --> 00:07:54.760
to tolerate another ESD event in
the future.

4eeb58f7-196c-4286-8f98-211aeb8cb0b1-0
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.760
You won't even know about it
until suddenly, for no apparent

4eeb58f7-196c-4286-8f98-211aeb8cb0b1-1
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.960
reason, the device just stops
working.

114e0a5a-cb4e-4b52-bf0a-5dd21a335eca-0
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.001
The culprit in all this is
something called the

114e0a5a-cb4e-4b52-bf0a-5dd21a335eca-1
00:08:05.001 --> 00:08:06.280
triboelectric effect.

8cbf8ffe-e93a-43f1-bd33-e1acd0d7c58f-0
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:11.240
The prefix tribo comes from a
Greek word that means to rub.

ce05175b-47b5-4a1d-a4c3-80a0741f753e-0
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.724
When two dissimilar materials
come into contact, they're likely

ce05175b-47b5-4a1d-a4c3-80a0741f753e-1
00:08:15.724 --> 00:08:17.640
to exchange electrons.

55a0c1c0-7fc8-4655-998e-337259f86fc7-0
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.440
Then, when they're separated, one
of the materials is chemically

55a0c1c0-7fc8-4655-998e-337259f86fc7-1
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.400
more likely to retain the
electrons than the other, so that

55a0c1c0-7fc8-4655-998e-337259f86fc7-2
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.920
material becomes negatively
charged.

a24320a3-2f50-41d6-b669-4f17b3c9f065-0
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.534
The other material, the one that
lost the electrons, becomes

a24320a3-2f50-41d6-b669-4f17b3c9f065-1
00:08:32.534 --> 00:08:33.760
positively charged.

1275a31e-31a9-45be-8239-23ef80014adb-0
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.675
This table gives you an idea of
various materials and their

1275a31e-31a9-45be-8239-23ef80014adb-1
00:08:38.675 --> 00:08:42.522
tendency to gain or lose
electrons, but this isn't an

1275a31e-31a9-45be-8239-23ef80014adb-2
00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:43.520
exact science.

c69caa0d-7f74-4e8d-a187-054c2ba32376-0
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.560
The amount of charge transferred
depends a lot on the surface

c69caa0d-7f74-4e8d-a187-054c2ba32376-1
00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.160
texture, contamination that may
be present, humidity, and a whole

c69caa0d-7f74-4e8d-a187-054c2ba32376-2
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.960
number of other factors.

9d39ccb9-4efc-4992-9de0-b16122d5eff1-0
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.718
The thing to remember is this
static electricity isn't just a

9d39ccb9-4efc-4992-9de0-b16122d5eff1-1
00:08:57.718 --> 00:09:01.676
matter of leather shoes on carpet
or running Combs through dry

9d39ccb9-4efc-4992-9de0-b16122d5eff1-2
00:09:01.676 --> 00:09:02.280
hair.

a9bf4ccf-00ae-46e7-9f3a-94ac829196b1-0
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.960
Damaging charges can accumulate
on any surface at any time.

0161d610-9f71-48d1-ab07-908ed2dd6d54-0
00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.121
And as we've seen, just because
you don't see a spark doesn't

0161d610-9f71-48d1-ab07-908ed2dd6d54-1
00:09:11.121 --> 00:09:12.120
mean you're safe.

e425e9ad-87d3-4c96-9ec1-4034a9690601-0
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:15.080
So let's get this straight.

e95d0e64-1d8b-49c4-815c-4fb5c1fa6461-0
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.383
Electrostatic discharge at levels
far too low to actually cause a

e95d0e64-1d8b-49c4-815c-4fb5c1fa6461-1
00:09:19.383 --> 00:09:23.572
spark can damage or destroy MOS
transistors, and you can't get

e95d0e64-1d8b-49c4-815c-4fb5c1fa6461-2
00:09:23.572 --> 00:09:27.006
away from static electricity due
to the triboelectric effect

e95d0e64-1d8b-49c4-815c-4fb5c1fa6461-3
00:09:27.006 --> 00:09:29.960
that's all around us.

b532450b-24fe-40bb-bbe9-4ca5be122d55-0
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.440
So what can we do?

ee1e6349-e39f-4a81-967d-02fdd52e03ed-0
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.373
Well, as it turns out, there's
actually quite a lot that we can

ee1e6349-e39f-4a81-967d-02fdd52e03ed-1
00:09:37.373 --> 00:09:37.520
do.

81e7f087-7198-4011-b743-43381a610420-0
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.166
First, all modern semiconductor
devices, with some rare

81e7f087-7198-4011-b743-43381a610420-1
00:09:41.166 --> 00:09:44.511
exceptions, include structures
that mitigate the risk of

81e7f087-7198-4011-b743-43381a610420-2
00:09:44.511 --> 00:09:45.920
electrostatic discharge.

bae7e2d7-a69d-46d7-9ab5-b795b447d87d-0
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.560
Now notice that I said mitigate
and not eliminate.

fc15b81d-d8e0-4e2d-94ed-9cb4e99ba6ce-0
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.448
You can still overwhelm the
protection circuitry with enough

fc15b81d-d8e0-4e2d-94ed-9cb4e99ba6ce-1
00:09:54.448 --> 00:09:57.995
electrostatic energy, but these
protection mechanisms are a vast

fc15b81d-d8e0-4e2d-94ed-9cb4e99ba6ce-2
00:09:57.995 --> 00:10:00.996
improvement over exposing an
unprotected mosque to the outside

fc15b81d-d8e0-4e2d-94ed-9cb4e99ba6ce-3
00:10:00.996 --> 00:10:01.760
world.

e0a5c813-79c9-43b6-bdbc-89f58adfd23d-0
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.840
Now in this diagram we see two
different kinds of protection.

ace14ed1-0196-4711-a1ff-0a769f2f09fd-0
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.709
Connected to the IO pin in
addition to the internal

ace14ed1-0196-4711-a1ff-0a769f2f09fd-1
00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:13.623
circuitry is a pair of diodes,
one connected to the power supply

ace14ed1-0196-4711-a1ff-0a769f2f09fd-2
00:10:13.623 --> 00:10:16.119
rail and the other to ground.

b109b547-a78d-4625-8373-f2b09a1e2489-0
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.142
Now since the diodes are reverse
biased, you might initially think

b109b547-a78d-4625-8373-f2b09a1e2489-1
00:10:20.142 --> 00:10:22.865
that they have no effect other
than to add a little capacitance

b109b547-a78d-4625-8373-f2b09a1e2489-2
00:10:22.865 --> 00:10:24.319
to the input stage.

02b59d05-15a7-440b-9378-2f99c79ebc2e-0
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.800
But in fact, they're critical.

44ae042f-4655-46ea-9e53-100a6f198e34-0
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.896
If a voltage surge that exceeds
the supply level is applied to

44ae042f-4655-46ea-9e53-100a6f198e34-1
00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:34.813
the IO pin, the upper diode will
begin to conduct, limiting the

44ae042f-4655-46ea-9e53-100a6f198e34-2
00:10:34.813 --> 00:10:38.118
voltage to the internal circuitry
to no more than one diode drop

44ae042f-4655-46ea-9e53-100a6f198e34-3
00:10:38.118 --> 00:10:40.199
above the supply rail.

2ccd2ebe-4ae7-4cb2-8886-3d72239d5536-0
00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.244
Now, similarly, if a surge that
drives the IO pin below ground is

2ccd2ebe-4ae7-4cb2-8886-3d72239d5536-1
00:10:45.244 --> 00:10:48.868
applied, the lower diode begins
to conduct, limiting the voltage

2ccd2ebe-4ae7-4cb2-8886-3d72239d5536-2
00:10:48.868 --> 00:10:52.190
to the internal circuitry to not
more than one diode drop below

2ccd2ebe-4ae7-4cb2-8886-3d72239d5536-3
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:53.640
ground.

7f233112-a8e9-41ac-9f67-24cba4a4d163-0
00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.323
Now, there are other
considerations for these diodes

7f233112-a8e9-41ac-9f67-24cba4a4d163-1
00:10:57.323 --> 00:11:00.603
that we're going to talk about in
just a moment, but for now,

7f233112-a8e9-41ac-9f67-24cba4a4d163-2
00:11:00.603 --> 00:11:03.830
understand that having these
diodes in place goes a long way

7f233112-a8e9-41ac-9f67-24cba4a4d163-3
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.951
toward protecting the sensitive
gate oxide in the internal

7f233112-a8e9-41ac-9f67-24cba4a4d163-4
00:11:06.951 --> 00:11:07.480
circuitry.

b6d976f8-4ce6-4098-abdb-264fd59f08df-0
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.360
But what if the supply pin is the
point that takes the surge?

0d63774d-b716-4b6a-aa41-f7e30a0e5b7e-0
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.640
Well, that's why we have the
power clamp in the circuit.

495eb253-c899-4174-b248-b68eb0c6e23e-0
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.381
This device, frequently some
kind of transient voltage

495eb253-c899-4174-b248-b68eb0c6e23e-1
00:11:18.381 --> 00:11:21.756
suppressor, works like a bi
directional zener diode,

495eb253-c899-4174-b248-b68eb0c6e23e-2
00:11:21.756 --> 00:11:25.257
conducting when the voltage
exceeds some predetermined

495eb253-c899-4174-b248-b68eb0c6e23e-3
00:11:25.257 --> 00:11:25.639
level.

a5ca6476-3143-4f25-86d0-8b76ef65b87f-0
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.697
And it's often designed to
dissipate a level of energy that

a5ca6476-3143-4f25-86d0-8b76ef65b87f-1
00:11:28.697 --> 00:11:31.305
would damage or destroy the
sensitive logic circuits that

a5ca6476-3143-4f25-86d0-8b76ef65b87f-2
00:11:31.305 --> 00:11:32.160
make the chip work.

ef51c9d7-c2e7-4b9e-9d6b-4c8ea7ef1255-0
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.960
Once again, the power clamp can
be overwhelmed by excessive

ef51c9d7-c2e7-4b9e-9d6b-4c8ea7ef1255-1
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.877
energy, but it's a lot better
than leaving the device

ef51c9d7-c2e7-4b9e-9d6b-4c8ea7ef1255-2
00:11:38.877 --> 00:11:40.120
completely unprotected.

27eb374e-ca4c-4e93-aed1-7eeb45915a6b-0
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.182
Now here's a closer look, and it
gives us the opportunity to see

27eb374e-ca4c-4e93-aed1-7eeb45915a6b-1
00:11:44.182 --> 00:11:46.960
the characteristics we need in
the protection diodes.

dd69381c-19a3-418f-9cca-ebc39d4b095d-0
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.084
Consider what happens when a
surge due to electrostatic

dd69381c-19a3-418f-9cca-ebc39d4b095d-1
00:11:51.084 --> 00:11:52.280
potential comes along.

57a43bd3-e32a-483d-acd0-b6fabfbabcb3-0
00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.167
If the surge is positive relative
to the power rail, the upper of

57a43bd3-e32a-483d-acd0-b6fabfbabcb3-1
00:11:56.167 --> 00:12:00.190
the two diodes conducts and the
current associated with the surge

57a43bd3-e32a-483d-acd0-b6fabfbabcb3-2
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.480
flows into the power rail.

9f95e1e3-ac87-43cb-b95a-b7bc04e40830-0
00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:06.502
But for this to work, the
switching time of the diode has

9f95e1e3-ac87-43cb-b95a-b7bc04e40830-1
00:12:06.502 --> 00:12:09.877
to be significantly less than the
expected rise time of the ESD

9f95e1e3-ac87-43cb-b95a-b7bc04e40830-2
00:12:09.877 --> 00:12:10.440
event.

30c84c63-a80e-4809-9af8-546e9d7617b4-0
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.420
If it's not, the diode will still
be in the off state when the

30c84c63-a80e-4809-9af8-546e9d7617b4-1
00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:18.434
surge is at the peak of its
destructive potential and the

30c84c63-a80e-4809-9af8-546e9d7617b4-2
00:12:18.434 --> 00:12:20.960
Moss input will invariably be
damaged.

0458d163-609d-4e9b-86e6-790961b178d2-0
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.600
So that's the first requirement.

6e38ef08-52bc-42c0-bd7e-5bade620b736-0
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.680
The diode has to be fast.

1b5c6174-b8fe-4764-a612-74de0ef7b42a-0
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.680
The second requirement is that
the diode has to be robust.

32571b1d-b26b-42c3-a1a7-2509e83d3d6f-0
00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.630
By this I mean that the diode
itself mustn't be damaged or

32571b1d-b26b-42c3-a1a7-2509e83d3d6f-1
00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:36.880
destroyed by the kind of ESD
events we expect to see.

aeae89e7-f509-41a9-8c91-4fd9fff9de4a-0
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.848
I mean, if the diode is
destroyed, it can't protect the

aeae89e7-f509-41a9-8c91-4fd9fff9de4a-1
00:12:40.848 --> 00:12:41.880
input on the chip.

81381804-9724-4448-83d7-79b1d1089c85-0
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.453
The diode structure might wind up
being quite large compared to

81381804-9724-4448-83d7-79b1d1089c85-1
00:12:45.453 --> 00:12:48.475
some of the other device
components just to allow it to

81381804-9724-4448-83d7-79b1d1089c85-2
00:12:48.475 --> 00:12:50.040
handle the expected currents.

71d39a1e-d7c5-4433-a4e5-3c85c756924f-0
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.113
Now the last two requirements
really don't have anything to do

71d39a1e-d7c5-4433-a4e5-3c85c756924f-1
00:12:56.113 --> 00:12:59.670
with ESD protection, but they do
concern compromising device

71d39a1e-d7c5-4433-a4e5-3c85c756924f-2
00:12:59.670 --> 00:13:02.119
operation when there isn't any
ESD event.

2e96c8a8-4ea0-48e4-9229-8d1d2b8b79e4-0
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.021
You see, many inputs are expected
to operate at high frequencies,

2e96c8a8-4ea0-48e4-9229-8d1d2b8b79e4-1
00:13:06.021 --> 00:13:09.898
maybe hundreds of megahertz,
perhaps as high as a few

2e96c8a8-4ea0-48e4-9229-8d1d2b8b79e4-2
00:13:09.898 --> 00:13:10.760
gigahertz.

5133b9c4-199a-4675-b87e-2f9307e8c019-0
00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.812
That means a few peak of areas
of additional capacitance on the

5133b9c4-199a-4675-b87e-2f9307e8c019-1
00:13:14.812 --> 00:13:17.415
input can have a significant
impact on the device

5133b9c4-199a-4675-b87e-2f9307e8c019-2
00:13:17.415 --> 00:13:18.040
parametrics.

8010a478-74e2-4f5a-9b7d-9fb46738351b-0
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:22.177
So for this reason we have to
keep the parasitic capacitance of

8010a478-74e2-4f5a-9b7d-9fb46738351b-1
00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:24.640
the protection diodes as low as
possible.

aef34230-337a-44b0-ab05-ed8737446d64-0
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.665
Finally, we have to recognize
that many electronic components

aef34230-337a-44b0-ab05-ed8737446d64-1
00:13:29.665 --> 00:13:30.880
go into applications.

61505ad1-6a7c-4f38-9ab0-9a5b3e95c439-0
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.360
They're power constrained.

dd84267a-7557-4cb7-9fe8-7366574ffc97-0
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.073
Now I'm thinking about battery
operated components, especially

dd84267a-7557-4cb7-9fe8-7366574ffc97-1
00:13:36.073 --> 00:13:39.196
those that have to operate for
months or years on battery

dd84267a-7557-4cb7-9fe8-7366574ffc97-2
00:13:39.196 --> 00:13:39.520
power.

bb8ac0e7-bc8a-4ac0-8142-80cd5027dee3-0
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.606
Minimizing current draw is
crucial and that means the

bb8ac0e7-bc8a-4ac0-8142-80cd5027dee3-1
00:13:43.606 --> 00:13:47.441
reverse bias leakage of these
diodes had better be as close to

bb8ac0e7-bc8a-4ac0-8142-80cd5027dee3-2
00:13:47.441 --> 00:13:48.720
0 as can be achieved.

fb50ecf3-776a-4334-929c-b32a7f91f0ff-0
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.317
So to summarize, these
protection diodes have to be

fb50ecf3-776a-4334-929c-b32a7f91f0ff-1
00:13:52.317 --> 00:13:52.640
fast.

dc416c83-176c-40e7-b317-ebca01ee30f3-0
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.317
They have to act quickly to route
the ESD surge current away from

dc416c83-176c-40e7-b317-ebca01ee30f3-1
00:13:56.317 --> 00:13:57.840
the internal circuitry.

f071a76d-04c9-4fd6-8d63-88159bfdff7b-0
00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.680
They have to be robust so that
they can handle the ESD current.

48a60523-420b-4588-ad17-40e662404a5b-0
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.040
They have to be extremely low
leakage.

d80aa5cd-b239-4145-97ad-1d6bb566fe6f-0
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.840
Hey, if the diodes are leaky,
they'll impact battery life.

e08263cc-22a0-4a50-ad6e-df79788d97e6-0
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:12.468
And if that input connects to
analog circuitry, just a little

e08263cc-22a0-4a50-ad6e-df79788d97e6-1
00:14:12.468 --> 00:14:15.760
leakage current can disturb the
accuracy of a low level sensor.

6434b9d9-9abc-4556-b311-234b9aad9372-0
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.080
And the diodes have to have a
very low junction capacitance.

27a83272-2b3e-4675-a573-60dba0861bd8-0
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.653
Otherwise you've just introduced
a low pass filter into your

27a83272-2b3e-4675-a573-60dba0861bd8-1
00:14:24.653 --> 00:14:25.080
circuit.

8fa2f7be-0a85-47f2-b0b0-554b10761a7a-0
00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.080
That's all for today.
