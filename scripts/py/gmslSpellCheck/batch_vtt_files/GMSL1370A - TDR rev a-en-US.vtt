Welcome to Time Domain Reflectometry or
TDR training.

805b00f7-a5ef-49b4-8bbd-d3945b328422-0
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.538
I am Chad Nelson and Applications
Engineer for the GMSL business unit at

805b00f7-a5ef-49b4-8bbd-d3945b328422-1
00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:17.800
ADI.

1f3d3187-6a7c-4d3e-952d-cedf1cfbc9de-0
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.720
We start with the most basic question.

cd7d302f-1698-4b60-81e9-73c18556bb72-0
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.320
What is a TDR? A TDR

fe83d645-ffb5-4854-8749-ce87a4052872-0
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.568
is a low voltage or low current pulse
sent through a transmission line,

fe83d645-ffb5-4854-8749-ce87a4052872-1
00:00:28.568 --> 00:00:32.994
with the reflections measured over time
to determine the properties of the

fe83d645-ffb5-4854-8749-ce87a4052872-2
00:00:32.994 --> 00:00:36.062
channel under test,
On the right side you can see a

fe83d645-ffb5-4854-8749-ce87a4052872-3
00:00:36.062 --> 00:00:40.664
representation of a transmission line
with a couple of disturbances along its

fe83d645-ffb5-4854-8749-ce87a4052872-4
00:00:40.664 --> 00:00:40.960
path.

6f32cca8-705f-46c2-8756-b08ddb500589-0
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.820
A narrow spot in the T line would
correspond to a bump up in the

6f32cca8-705f-46c2-8756-b08ddb500589-1
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.415
characteristic impedance,
while a wide spot would correspond to a

6f32cca8-705f-46c2-8756-b08ddb500589-2
00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:48.960
bump down.

a919853f-1eb5-4493-8c2f-26fe68e52a7c-0
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.861
When the TDR pulse is sent down the trace,
these discontinuities will cause

a919853f-1eb5-4493-8c2f-26fe68e52a7c-1
00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:55.360
reflections in the signal.

f4f17a8c-3500-4c6e-88a9-06314abac568-0
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.645
The voltage is converted to
characteristic impedance and shown in

f4f17a8c-3500-4c6e-88a9-06314abac568-1
00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:01.160
time on the TDR equipment.

5409e99c-6b01-4771-9552-382a5ef41215-0
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.720
What are TDRS used for?

94651a1c-a089-4f0f-886b-59340dc0e861-0
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.680
Wireless parameters show you the
frequency domain response of a channel.

0bdb0821-a3cf-4552-ac6e-00cbe949654c-0
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.840
A TDR shows you the time domain response
of a channel.

358a6e28-914c-403c-9ab8-6af4d9863170-0
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.386
Because TDR's are in the time domain,
we can pinpoint the physical locations of

358a6e28-914c-403c-9ab8-6af4d9863170-1
00:01:17.386 --> 00:01:18.320
discontinuities.

941c7eaf-1c5a-478e-878f-9c37598ee0dd-0
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.162
We can do this by using the propagation
velocity of the signal and the time delay

941c7eaf-1c5a-478e-878f-9c37598ee0dd-1
00:01:23.162 --> 00:01:27.520
of the disturbance to locate its location
relative to the signal launch point.

7aded093-8743-4657-8315-8c0cd2b6f134-0
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.270
An even easier way to locate the
disturbance is to use your finger pressed

7aded093-8743-4657-8315-8c0cd2b6f134-1
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.680
on the transmission line.

a4e71aef-932e-480e-8bcc-399b855dc80e-0
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.936
Your finger adds capacitance increases
the relative dielectric constant,

a4e71aef-932e-480e-8bcc-399b855dc80e-1
00:01:37.936 --> 00:01:41.280
causing the impedance to drop wherever
your finger is placed.

6d9149b4-9459-4448-8b69-6cfef87963f9-0
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.640
So what does a good trace look like on a
TDR?

86781fc7-1a60-4884-9041-46070894c986-0
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.770
Here we see the launch onto the PCB with
a small bump up then down as the signal

86781fc7-1a60-4884-9041-46070894c986-1
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.160
transitions to the PCB through the SMA
connector.

b7f52e02-58ac-49c4-b204-e194eb5888f0-0
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.983
These are likely due to the ground layer
being pulled slightly away from the edge

b7f52e02-58ac-49c4-b204-e194eb5888f0-1
00:02:02.983 --> 00:02:07.800
of the PCB resulting in the bump up
because the large landing pad of the pin.

7daa3374-3cb1-4053-a16e-7296dc75ae4b-0
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.360
We do a ground cut out under the pad to
reduce the excess capacitance.

f7e689b1-30c7-4351-bb55-c7a8f45c15f4-0
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.014
In this case we may need to make the cut
out a little larger to push the impedance

f7e689b1-30c7-4351-bb55-c7a8f45c15f4-1
00:02:18.014 --> 00:02:18.200
up.

815b2780-5b72-429f-bfc3-ee69dd93e7da-0
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.067
In the case of the AC capacitor,
our ground cut out is about perfect and

815b2780-5b72-429f-bfc3-ee69dd93e7da-1
00:02:23.067 --> 00:02:26.640
creates just a small bump relative to the
T line impedance.

ef0f78c4-9545-4e24-a17a-9ac368ef2f6a-0
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.680
The rest of the T line is slightly low
but definitely within the good range.

14212af6-dcb8-4c9b-91b0-caae084bd234-0
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.793
We then get to the Fakra connector and
there is a little bump up then down due

14212af6-dcb8-4c9b-91b0-caae084bd234-1
00:02:36.793 --> 00:02:40.520
to the transition into the pin landing
pad and the ground cut out.

5d4f7f36-415c-4dd1-8708-7b0556a400c9-0
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.320
Then there is a bump up,
likely due to the larger gap between the

5d4f7f36-415c-4dd1-8708-7b0556a400c9-1
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.800
edge of the PCB and the Fakra metal
shield.

0dbbcb30-ed95-4e8f-9042-667da81e03c3-0
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.163
There was no cable plugged in,
so the impedance shoots up at the end of

0dbbcb30-ed95-4e8f-9042-667da81e03c3-1
00:02:52.163 --> 00:02:52.880
the connector.

5ab28507-b112-4363-ac15-73a75c50cdb9-0
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.798
The resulting S parameters with the long
cable and a 50 ohm load is a respectable

5ab28507-b112-4363-ac15-73a75c50cdb9-1
00:02:58.798 --> 00:03:00.040
return loss result.

6da147e6-5974-4eaa-a131-e8021315d4b6-0
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.280
So now we take a look at what a bad trace
looks like on a TDR.

2f1f2ef6-049a-4d4f-9d41-a8ceb69b29c7-0
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.166
In this case we see a pretty significant
mismatch in the PCB impedance as well as

2f1f2ef6-049a-4d4f-9d41-a8ceb69b29c7-1
00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:15.760
a pretty ugly launch onto the HMTD
connector.

29fd7834-0f6c-43e5-876d-c1fc2c8d11f9-0
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.720
This results in a failing return loss
result for GMSL3 operation.

7f76a493-9815-4cff-b889-c6cb6d552e7c-0
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.840
So when to use a TDR and when to use S
parameters?

be214d06-b67e-42bb-a79f-9339507dc899-0
00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.800
TDR's are best used to physically locate
problem areas on a channel.

3a470b39-6700-40a6-9a70-a7559a0f41ce-0
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.813
DDR's cannot determine whether a GMSL
channel is compliant but are a great

3a470b39-6700-40a6-9a70-a7559a0f41ce-1
00:03:37.813 --> 00:03:39.040
diagnostics tool.

38dfdf82-6d2c-4446-ae38-bf838fceea6d-0
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.360
S parameters are required to determine
channel compliance.

b631300f-85c6-4754-a023-46ac6ae28b2f-0
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.551
The S parameters give a more complete
picture of the channel performance and

b631300f-85c6-4754-a023-46ac6ae28b2f-1
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:51.920
must be part of every new hardware design
verification.

4610b5a9-25d3-4c86-8337-7f4defb6ca99-0
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.000
Thank you for your time and listening to
this TDR presentation.

50e8bd54-ffe7-42a6-ae7c-baddad5c2c81-0
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.154
Please,
if you have any questions about TDR and

50e8bd54-ffe7-42a6-ae7c-baddad5c2c81-1
00:04:01.154 --> 00:04:05.320
its use for GMSL,
please don't hesitate to contact me.

18dc083f-0d8c-40e6-8994-06759fe26cee-0
