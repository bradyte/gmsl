Hi,
this is Chad Nelson from Analog Devices

10eaf76e-8003-4623-92a1-4b5588c7ea0a-1
00:00:11.247 --> 00:00:12.840
GMSL Applications team.

fc3e5546-2230-4b66-8078-3fcf91b499dc-0
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.240
I'm going to be presenting on cables and
connectors for automotive video links.

95908694-92d6-4b61-ab6b-6dd26a6af9de-0
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.929
The cable and connector types used for
automotive cert as links are listed here

95908694-92d6-4b61-ab6b-6dd26a6af9de-1
00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:24.680
in this chart.

dfe3f386-e6e0-422b-8c65-0a55b48488e7-0
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.834
The left column shows the various cable
types including coaxial shielded twisted

dfe3f386-e6e0-422b-8c65-0a55b48488e7-1
00:00:30.834 --> 00:00:33.894
pair,
twin axial or shielded parallel pair,

dfe3f386-e6e0-422b-8c65-0a55b48488e7-2
00:00:33.894 --> 00:00:38.346
shielded twisted quad,
and finally dual twin axe slash shielded

dfe3f386-e6e0-422b-8c65-0a55b48488e7-3
00:00:38.346 --> 00:00:39.320
parallel pair.

fd6c65b9-5fc3-45e2-bc59-5875b95cc72d-0
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.965
The middle column lists the specific
connectors associated with certain cable

fd6c65b9-5fc3-45e2-bc59-5875b95cc72d-1
00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:44.280
types.

18e5c634-ef29-4767-80cf-0af3a2b5febb-0
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.760
These include HFM or mini Focra,
mate AX and the standard Focra.

90ec50b9-ca31-43c1-9c52-9dd5652e9d37-0
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.440
For shielded parallel pair.

716ef9fb-a766-4a70-84aa-b12f2745ad05-0
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.600
We have the HMTD connector also used for
twin axial SPP cables.

b058fd6c-1a70-4b40-9b9e-3595445057b4-0
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.340
The HSD connector is used for shielded
twisted quad and dual twin axe whereas

b058fd6c-1a70-4b40-9b9e-3595445057b4-1
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.760
I've only seen HSAL 2 used with STQ
cables.

4adbd464-b07f-4876-a1d9-c84f4b1af091-0
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.017
The connector performance in terms of low
reflections is led by the HMTD connector

4adbd464-b07f-4876-a1d9-c84f4b1af091-1
00:01:15.017 --> 00:01:17.680
followed by MATE, AXH, FM and FOCRA.

0a91cd3a-1f45-4c50-904f-8a7a753c066a-0
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.431
HSD performance falls below these and
work is being done to determine if we can

0a91cd3a-1f45-4c50-904f-8a7a753c066a-1
00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:27.400
recommend STQ cables for use with GMSL 3.

69f837df-2df6-4544-b360-1e74e5c3b4b9-0
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.960
Coaxial cables have a lot going for them.

1483da46-2ba7-4be9-8ee8-8d6c235d3d64-0
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.982
They typically have very good signal
shielding and have lower insertion loss

1483da46-2ba7-4be9-8ee8-8d6c235d3d64-1
00:01:36.982 --> 00:01:38.920
relative to differential cables.

e528d70d-1f18-4b8f-9448-1fbaa3c85d89-0
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.712
Coaxial cables have been thoroughly
tested with GMSL 1-2 and three to great

e528d70d-1f18-4b8f-9448-1fbaa3c85d89-1
00:01:44.712 --> 00:01:45.280
success.

09ee69fe-7b2f-4ec3-b9eb-3e237569c0f7-0
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.600
Sending power over these cables is common.

b78e3d39-3460-46ff-9c49-57eac7903d93-0
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.592
The negatives relate to the fact that a
single ended signal is more susceptible

b78e3d39-3460-46ff-9c49-57eac7903d93-1
00:01:55.592 --> 00:01:58.040
to things like bulk current injection.

c3a16485-9a88-46dd-8d94-47267222fec3-0
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.615
Also,
the single ended trace on the PCB can be

c3a16485-9a88-46dd-8d94-47267222fec3-1
00:02:02.615 --> 00:02:06.800
disrupted more easily by electromagnetic
interference.

6fa10c4b-abc2-43b0-90b3-1a2ff262a9e3-0
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.234
Coaxial connectors include the ubiquitous
FAKRA, the newer, more compact HFM,

6fa10c4b-abc2-43b0-90b3-1a2ff262a9e3-1
00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:16.200
and MATE AX.

de232754-f08b-4857-9a68-9929d7208a0c-0
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.000
The compact nature of the HFM and Mate AX
lend nicely to ganged connectors.

33c7a992-8fc0-4831-b11b-767d5d7f3453-0
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.051
Note that ganged connectors require extra
design work to ensure low crosstalk

33c7a992-8fc0-4831-b11b-767d5d7f3453-1
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:29.080
between signals.

30f06ad7-a52c-4529-b62e-1b73813ad88d-0
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.676
Shielded twisted pair cables have an
advantage over coax that arises from the

30f06ad7-a52c-4529-b62e-1b73813ad88d-1
00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:37.480
nature of a differential signal.

16402f8c-853e-41e7-b84a-26b49833d5aa-0
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.810
Although the shielding on STP cables is
not quite as effective as coax,

16402f8c-853e-41e7-b84a-26b49833d5aa-1
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.952
this is typically more than offset by the
fact that signals induced on the cable

16402f8c-853e-41e7-b84a-26b49833d5aa-2
00:02:47.952 --> 00:02:51.000
will generate a mostly common mode
disturbance.

e96227fe-1fea-438f-87b7-c3e0eb31fafe-0
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.697
Differential receivers can reject common
mode energy,

e96227fe-1fea-438f-87b7-c3e0eb31fafe-1
00:02:54.697 --> 00:02:56.680
helping their performance with EMC.

4d59e2b4-f173-420d-aeb5-85fe00d3a05c-0
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.993
These cables are also less susceptible to
bulk current injection due to

4d59e2b4-f173-420d-aeb5-85fe00d3a05c-1
00:03:01.993 --> 00:03:03.320
differential signaling.

12a98cdf-f552-4756-8fd5-b543493902cd-0
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.280
These have been tested with great results
for GMSL 1-2 and three.

f99970c3-b13f-40d7-9801-787cd93ac2f8-0
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.613
One disadvantage is that these cables can
exhibit mode conversion if not

f99970c3-b13f-40d7-9801-787cd93ac2f8-1
00:03:14.613 --> 00:03:15.920
manufactured properly.

60496e60-df3c-431e-b163-17431b5a49dc-0
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.280
This can lead to timing jitter and eye
closure, reducing link margin.

ac7e0a26-44db-4916-9b63-93b4c125060f-0
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.349
Due to the need to maintain a small cable
diameter in spite of the extra conductor,

ac7e0a26-44db-4916-9b63-93b4c125060f-1
00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.280
the wire gauges are kept smaller and
result in more loss per meter than coax.

96f156af-95fd-486f-ad73-830be6e3534e-0
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.123
Shielded parallel pair or twin axe cables
are similar to STP cables except instead

96f156af-95fd-486f-ad73-830be6e3534e-1
00:03:39.123 --> 00:03:42.248
of using A twist to hold the wires
together,

96f156af-95fd-486f-ad73-830be6e3534e-2
00:03:42.248 --> 00:03:47.040
a foil wrap or bonded installation keeps
the wires properly aligned.

aec0ae8d-596f-4374-baba-23e3bab68c9a-0
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.757
When compared to STP cables,
these have the benefit of improved or

aec0ae8d-596f-4374-baba-23e3bab68c9a-1
00:03:52.757 --> 00:03:55.880
reduced differential to common mode
conversion.

8fc0e03e-5b64-4c48-9dde-6169b9c090ca-0
00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.192
Having said this,
I've not noticed excessive mode

8fc0e03e-5b64-4c48-9dde-6169b9c090ca-1
00:04:00.192 --> 00:04:05.280
conversion in any of the most recent STP
or STQ cables that I've measured.

4b6f8470-c30e-4e70-9ec4-e7018004deff-0
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.434
The parallel nature of these cables make
flexibility not as symmetric as the

4b6f8470-c30e-4e70-9ec4-e7018004deff-1
00:04:11.434 --> 00:04:12.400
twisted cables.

7511b64d-384e-4731-a1ec-ba206b34ab94-0
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.040
These cables have historically been more
expensive than standard STP cables.

f59bd73f-db92-4d35-9f17-fed58791c5de-0
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.920
HMTD is the standard connector for STP
and SPP cables.

3a11860f-6137-41c0-a9a6-68981509ad1c-0
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.418
The connector has excellent return loss
characteristics and exceptional inline

3a11860f-6137-41c0-a9a6-68981509ad1c-1
00:04:31.418 --> 00:04:35.228
connector continuity,
making Daisy chaining of multiple cables

3a11860f-6137-41c0-a9a6-68981509ad1c-2
00:04:35.228 --> 00:04:36.680
practically a non issue.

8581b449-3fb6-4ced-8421-12a9a7fd8090-0
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.346
Because of the nature of differential
signaling,

8581b449-3fb6-4ced-8421-12a9a7fd8090-1
00:04:41.346 --> 00:04:46.680
AC coupling the ground connection on one
side of the link to reduce ground loop

8581b449-3fb6-4ced-8421-12a9a7fd8090-2
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.880
issues is fairly straightforward.

30c414db-b3ef-4c77-ac96-14746ce03542-0
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.130
Shielded twisted quad cables are similar
to STP cables,

30c414db-b3ef-4c77-ac96-14746ce03542-1
00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.440
except that these contain 2 differential
signal pairs.

70cd7c84-fbe1-4f15-ac39-d2b545c9bb1b-0
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.120
These pairs are oriented 90Â° from each
other in a cross pattern.

cb0a636b-6936-4814-b6a1-de849ea8c3d4-0
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.040
This orientation helps reduce crosstalk
and is surprisingly good at doing so.

6f45bad7-c293-4710-ab21-f9e7e0a7db79-0
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.760
Some advantages are that EMC performance
is good due to differential signaling.

87ae515b-162d-4c56-ad2b-c95205ef3768-0
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.981
Another benefit is that 2 GMSL links can
be carried across a single cable,

87ae515b-162d-4c56-ad2b-c95205ef3768-1
00:05:18.981 --> 00:05:23.280
resulting in 12 gigabits per second
downstream data in dual link mode.

f83c92d7-d692-4f82-953d-e90382fe259f-0
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.113
Another option is to use one pair for the
GMSL link and the other for power,

f83c92d7-d692-4f82-953d-e90382fe259f-1
00:05:29.113 --> 00:05:32.240
eliminating the need for POC filter
networks.

b50680dd-deca-4087-a8f0-8f7efbfd57a1-0
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.240
These cables are very popular in China.

af90e6d6-4266-4550-a7c6-ac00ebfd96d0-0
00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.830
The disadvantages are that there is
crosstalk between the pairs that does

af90e6d6-4266-4550-a7c6-ac00ebfd96d0-1
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.023
limit the maximum reach,
and the HSD connectors have higher return

af90e6d6-4266-4550-a7c6-ac00ebfd96d0-2
00:05:45.023 --> 00:05:46.399
loss than other types.

805743ba-408e-4a8c-bfab-903c47bcd1bf-0
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.680
The connectors used for STQ cables are
the HSD and the HSAL 2 connector.

b1d67814-33b2-427b-88ed-ec759a36e632-0
00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.148
Rosenberger's HSD connector is much more
popular than Molex's HSAL 2 connector,

b1d67814-33b2-427b-88ed-ec759a36e632-1
00:06:01.148 --> 00:06:03.520
at least for Cerdez applications.

2fc69f99-7998-4bd5-bd61-5e46a8c1448b-0
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.913
These connectors struggle with return
loss,

2fc69f99-7998-4bd5-bd61-5e46a8c1448b-1
00:06:06.913 --> 00:06:12.000
so they do require extra consideration to
achieve GMSL channel specification limits.

60add089-b7b7-4941-a02b-5e31823fa709-0
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.311
I've seen marketing materials showing
this type of cable,

60add089-b7b7-4941-a02b-5e31823fa709-1
00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:20.440
but have yet to see any in person.

4aec75cc-d583-449c-a383-d87276208a50-0
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.339
These cables should have good EMC
performance due to being differential,

4aec75cc-d583-449c-a383-d87276208a50-1
00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:29.606
and they should have improved mode
conversion performance over standard STP

4aec75cc-d583-449c-a383-d87276208a50-2
00:06:29.606 --> 00:06:30.000
cables.

4ad83bb6-688b-411d-b87f-804433a59773-0
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.898
The disadvantages are that they have not
yet been tested by Analog Devices similar

4ad83bb6-688b-411d-b87f-804433a59773-1
00:06:36.898 --> 00:06:37.840
to STQ cables.

bb83265e-bd9d-4f6e-a7a8-e8164c4a1ed1-0
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.363
There is a potential for crosstalk
between the pairs,

bb83265e-bd9d-4f6e-a7a8-e8164c4a1ed1-1
00:06:41.363 --> 00:06:45.800
and these cables are expected to be more
expensive than STQ cables.

8a2d7690-81bf-43bd-a7f6-e3fc0de344c4-0
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.200
Here we have a cable information table.

bee144d1-f22a-4a9b-ae06-cd847398d6da-0
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.800
This is an incomplete list of cables,
but these are some of the popular ones.

a094154e-4628-4adf-9d03-e7e0ee11cfd6-0
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.343
These include Leone of Germany,
Shikoku of Japan,

a094154e-4628-4adf-9d03-e7e0ee11cfd6-1
00:06:59.343 --> 00:07:02.440
and Gabauer and Griller of Austria.

cd30f15b-3731-4ba8-8742-d6a08bc776b5-0
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.036
For each of these models,
we show the loss per meter and the

cd30f15b-3731-4ba8-8742-d6a08bc776b5-1
00:07:08.036 --> 00:07:10.480
maximum reach per GMSL data rate.
