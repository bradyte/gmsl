### Deliverables
* Leverage the DFE registers to read out equalization parameters for different length cabling.
  * Assumption: DFE values should be different for the different cable lengths
  * Focus should be on DFEs since it's the more readily discussed topic with our AEQ system
* Be able to measure the cable channel and P2P channel
  * Attempt to translate to a transfer function of the channel
* Use this to model a system in serdespy or LT spice, not sure yet
* Turn off AEQ to see how the system performs
* Leverage DFE tools in serdespy to optimize transmission
  * would be cool if it correlates to any capacity
  * ideally just show the benefits of DFE
